# DATCAN-Deep-Learning-for-Brain-Computer-Interface
DATCAN — Calibration-Free Brain–Computer Interface: Achieved ~80% subject-independent decoding (12 SSVEP targets) and 100–140 bits/min ITR in 1s windows. Combines deep learning and neuroscience priors (contrastive alignment, adversarial adaptation, TRCA, FBCCA) to enable real-time, non-invasive neurotech.
